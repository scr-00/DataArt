# ðŸŽ¶ Coldplay Live Concert Timeline

## Stage 1: Static Skeleton

This project is a timeline-based web app that showcases Coldplay's most iconic live concerts. The goal of this first stage is to create a static HTML structure that will later be enhanced with dynamic content, filters, and interactivity.

### ðŸ”§ Features in This Stage

- **Header**: Includes the app logo (Coldplay Live Timeline) and a theme toggle button (currently non-functional).
- **Navigation Bar**: A placeholder for future filters such as year, location, or tour name.
- **Main Section**: Displays the purpose of the timeline and a sample concert event.
- **Timeline Section**: A `section` with a sample article detailing Coldplayâ€™s 2022 Buenos Aires concert from the *Music of the Spheres* tour.
- **Modal**: An empty modal container for future pop-up details on concert events.
- **Semantic HTML Tags**: Uses `<main>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, and other proper HTML5 elements to keep the structure clean and accessible.
